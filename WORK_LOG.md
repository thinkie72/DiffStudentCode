| February 24th |   2:30-3pm   |                                                                     I spent a lot of time planning out some strategies on the whiteboard. I thought about where to start, what to save, and if I could take any shortcuts. None of these amounted to much, so I'll keep looking... |
| February 26th | 12:45-1:45pm |                                                          Still nothing written in code here. I internalized Sabrina's approach that we did on the whiteboard. Once we'd finished, I helped her troubleshoot and think about ways to code it. I'm gonna start implementing it soon. |
| February 27th |  9:30-10pm   | I implemented Sabrina's method which works for two of the test cases, but not the others, I'll figure out why in a minute. This strategy seems to generally work but I'm not sure if that's only for the test cases we've tried. I'll keep working to get to the bottom of this... |
